## Apfelstrudel
 We publish essays on media, storytelling and digital platforms. The focus is on close reading and analysis—how contemporary shows, formats, and media shape the way we watch, read, and pay attention.
 
 The writing is intended for general readers and editorial platforms that value clarity, structure, and argument over trend-chasing or academic abstraction.
